1. How long did you spend on this test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
I have worked on like 6-8 hours on this.

I have written a framework added these technologies to the framework:
1.Added Page object model to the framework. (Path: Cypress-> Support -> PageObject) 2.Added Locators in a seperate package to make easier to change locators to anyone. 3.Created reusable methods in seperate folders and called to the from the Test Class.(Path: Cypress-> Support -> Commands) 4.Added URLs seperately (cypress.json) 5.Added global level timeouts to the project whcih is a good practice (in selenium we use Explicit waits and implicit waits for this) (cypress.json) 6.Added Data driven framework and added user names and password in a seperate config files (Path: Cypress-> fixtures -> example.json)

If i had more time i would like to add below things to the framework
1.I will be adding Excel sheet and insert data to the framework using excel. (improve the data driven framework) 2.I will be more focusing on Reporting, Logging and add those featuers to the framework which is required. 3.I will be adding dashboard to the cypress framework which is a cool feature. 4.I will add BDD like cucumber to the framework , write testcases using cucumber and integrate it with the javascript coding. 5.I will create seperate section for API testing and seperate section for UI testing. 6.I will integrate framework to support DB level testing. 7.I will improve the CI/CD pipeline process and adding reporting to the CI/CD once completed the push command.

2. Have you learned something new doing this test? If yes, describe it here.
Yes, Since i have good knowledge in Selenium framework development I have used most of my experience to build a cypress framework.Because of the time limitation i couldnt able to do above mentioned (things to do) things. But had a chance to build firstly mentioned things to the framework.

3. How would you improve this API you just used?
To improve the API layer testing we can add BDD to that and used cucumber to write testcases and then its easy to pass parameters to the API. And also need to keep API request in a seperate file, its not a good practice to keep it inside the code.

4. What could be improved in the description of the task/use cases so it would be more clear what the requirements are?
Description is clear well structured. I saw 2 issues there.

Closing square bracket is missing.

5. What are your tools/frameworks of choice when testing each type of test? Why did you choose these tools?
For this kind of test if we are using selenium for UI level testing we can use Rest assuared for API level testing, But now with cypress we can do both using 1 tool/framwork which is really easy since it can contact with the web browser payload and UI at once.

6. Describe yourself using JSON.
I have 6-7 years of testing experience using JSON and also have automation experience for API using SoapUI with grrovy scripting, POSTMAN with java scripting and restassuared for that mentioned 6-7 years.
